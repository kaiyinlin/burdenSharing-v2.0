# BurdenSharing v2.0 - master_20220105

This is the master version of burdenSharing v2.0 that is created by hsin and based on burdenSharing v1.8

* data_v22: rewritten and organized codes. Use the old cost term setting. The results should be similar to data_v21
* data_v24: Use the old cost term function, but change the exponent of cost term (after 1945) to 0.5. The cost term after 1945 is 0.2*T^0.5
* data_v25: Use the old cost term function, but change the exponent of cost term (after 1943) to 0.8. The cost term after 1943 is 0.2*T^0.8.
